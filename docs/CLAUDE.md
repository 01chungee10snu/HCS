# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio and profile website project for Han Choong-seok (한충석), a Human Resource Development professional at Hyundai Steel. The goal is to create a static website that can be deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

- **Data.json**: Contains comprehensive profile data including personal information, education, experience, skills, certifications, and publications in JSON format
- **Purpose.md**: Project goals and requirements (in Korean)

## Data Management

Personal information is managed through a single JSON file (`Data.json`) that serves as the data source for the website. This file contains:

- Basic personal information (`basics`)
- Education history (`education`) 
- Professional experience (`experience`) with detailed achievements
- Skills and competencies (`skills`)
- Certifications (`certifications`)
- Publications (`publications`)
- External links (`externalLinks`)

## Development Goals

According to `Purpose.md`, the key objectives are:
1. Create a personal profile/portfolio website
2. Deploy via GitHub Pages by adding `index.html` to the main branch
3. Implement exceptional design quality
4. Use the JSON file for data management
5. Enable viewing through GitHub Pages

## Technology Approach

This appears to be a static website project that will:
- Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript to render the portfolio
- Pull data from `Data.json` for content
- Be hosted on GitHub Pages
- Focus on excellent visual design and user experience

## Important Notes

- All content is in Korean
- The project is focused on creating a professional portfolio for HR industry experience
- Data structure supports complex professional achievements and career progression
- External links include LinkedIn profile and news articles
